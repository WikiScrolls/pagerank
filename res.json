It utilizes various forms of media as technology has made the dissemination of information more efficient. Primary examples of platforms utilized and examined include journalism and advertising. Mass communication, unlike interpersonal communication and organizational communication, focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content and information that is being mass communicated persuades or affects the behavior, attitude, opinion, or emotion of people receiving the information.\nNarrowly, mass communication is the transmission of messages to many recipients at a time. However, mass communication can be broadly understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\nFrom a critical perspective, mass communication has been interpreted as an omnipresent medium that transcends conventional sender-receiver paradigms. The philosopher Peter Sloterdijk posits that it operates not merely as a unidirectional transmission from source to recipient, but rather as an immersive environment or \"atmosphere\" permeating societal existence. This environment, he argues, is involuntarily absorbed\u2014akin to a respiratory act\u2014through necessities of existence, thereby shaping collective consciousness and lived experience.","contentmodel":"wikitext","pagelanguage":"en","pagelanguagehtmlcode":"en","pagelanguagedir":"ltr","touched":"2025-11-13T14:23:57Z","lastrevid":1320832031,"length":40669,"fullurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_communication","editurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mass_communication&action=edit","canonicalurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_communication"},"77744157":{"pageid":77744157,"ns":0,"title":"Listed buildings in Finghall","extract":"Finghall is a civil parish in the county of North Yorkshire, England.
