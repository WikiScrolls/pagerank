Other terms used are the batsman being out, the batting side losing a wicket, and the fielding side (and often the bowler) taking a wicket. The ball becomes dead (meaning that no further runs can be scored off that delivery), and the dismissed batsman must leave the field of play for the rest of their team's innings, to be replaced by a team-mate. A team's innings ends if ten of the eleven team members are dismissed. Players bat in pairs so, when only one batsman remains who can be not out, it is not possible for the team to bat any longer. This is known as dismissing or bowling out the batting team, who are said to be all out.\nThe most common methods of dismissing a batsman are (in descending order of frequency): caught, bowled, leg before wicket, run out, and stumped. Of these, the leg before wicket and stumped methods of dismissal can be seen as related to, or being special cases of, the bowled and run out methods of dismissal respectively.\nMost methods of dismissal do not apply on an illegal delivery (i.e. a wide or no-ball) or on the free hit delivery that follows a no-ball in certain competitions.","contentmodel":"wikitext","pagelanguage":"en","pagelanguagehtmlcode":"en","pagelanguagedir":"ltr","touched":"2025-11-04T18:51:45Z","lastrevid":1317883338,"length":30784,"fullurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)","editurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dismissal_(cricket)&action=edit","canonicalurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)"},"8297364":{"pageid":8297364,"ns":0,"title":"Secretomotor","extract":"The adjective secretomotor refers to the capacity of a structure (often a nerve) to induce a gland to secrete a substance (usually mucus or serous fluid).\nSecretomotor nerve endings are frequently contrasted with sensory neuron endings and motor nerve endings.
