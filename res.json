The five main categories of adrenergic receptors are: \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23, although there are more subtypes, and agonists vary in specificity between these receptors, and may be classified respectively. However, there are also other mechanisms of adrenergic agonism. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are endogenous and broad-spectrum. More selective agonists are more useful in pharmacology.\nAn adrenergic agent is a drug, or other substance, which has effects similar to, or the same as, epinephrine (adrenaline). Thus, it is a kind of sympathomimetic agent. Alternatively, it may refer to something which is susceptible to epinephrine, or similar substances, such as a biological receptor (specifically, the adrenergic receptors).","contentmodel":"wikitext","pagelanguage":"en","pagelanguagehtmlcode":"en","pagelanguagedir":"ltr","touched":"2025-11-04T18:52:37Z","lastrevid":1312020337,"length":7208,"fullurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_agonist","editurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adrenergic_agonist&action=edit","canonicalurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_agonist"},"20013924":{"pageid":20013924,"ns":0,"title":"W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kara\u015b","extract":"W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kara\u015b (31 August 1893 \u2013 28 May 1942) was a Polish military officer and sport shooter who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Though mentioned briefly in the first Star Wars film (A New Hope, 1977), the war itself was not depicted until Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005). The Clone Wars are also the setting for three eponymous projects: a 2D animated series (2003\u20132005), a 3D film (2008), and a 3D animated series (2008\u20132014, 2020). They have featured in numerous Star Wars books, comics and games.\nWithin the Star Wars narrative, the Clone Wars involve a three-year war fought to prevent thousands of planetary systems from seceding from the Galactic Republic and joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS), colloquially referred to as the Separatists or Separatist Alliance. The Republic uses an army of clone troopers led by the Jedi Order against the Separatist battle droid army. The conflict was a scheme by the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, secretly the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious, seeking to implement the Sith's long-term plans to wipe out all Jedi and take over the galaxy. Palpatine intended this by giving the clone troopers a secret executive command, \"Order 66\" (in the form of a control chip) embedded in their brains, instantly making clones perceive their Jedi officers as traitors and kill them. He succeeded in issuing the command in Revenge of the Sith promptly leading to the deaths of numerous Jedi around the galaxy, allowing Palpatine to gain total power and ultimately convert the democratic Galactic Republic into the fascist autocratic Galactic Empire, a reign controlled through a military\u2013industrial complex and featured in the original trilogy.\nLucas used the Clone Wars narrative to answer questions about the original trilogy, such as how the Empire originated and how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.","contentmodel":"wikitext","pagelanguage":"en","pagelanguagehtmlcode":"en","pagelanguagedir":"ltr","touched":"2025-11-16T13:13:03Z","lastrevid":1322295540,"length":32640,"fullurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars","editurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clone_Wars&action=edit","canonicalurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars"},"24145375":{"pageid":24145375,"ns":0,"title":"C24H31FO6","extract":"The molecular formula C24H31FO6 (molar mass: 434.50 g/mol) may refer to:","contentmodel":"wikitext","pagelanguage":"en","pagelanguagehtmlcode":"en","pagelanguagedir":"ltr","touched":"2025-10-21T01:00:26Z","lastrevid":1107026555,"length":338,"fullurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C24H31FO6","editurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C24H31FO6&action=edit","canonicalurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C24H31FO6"},"1573280":{"pageid":1573280,"ns":0,"title":"UWEC","extract":"UWEC may refer to:","contentmodel":"wikitext","pagelanguage":"en","pagelanguagehtmlcode":"en","pagelanguagedir":"ltr","touched":"2025-11-14T14:33:15Z","lastrevid":1302127528,"length":308,"fullurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWEC","editurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UWEC&action=edit","canonicalurl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWEC"},"2066600":{"pageid":2066600,"ns":0,"title":"Coffy","extract":"Coffy is a 1973 American blaxploitation action film written and directed by Jack Hill.
